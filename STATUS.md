# File Statuses

A header comment at the top of each source file in this package includes a status note. File status will be one of the following.

**Stable:** public API provided by the file will change a breaking way, in the main branch of the repository, only via major
version tags. New additions to API and functionality can occur at any time.

**Experimental:** file contents are subject to change on the main branch of the repository at any time without warning, including
breaking changes.
