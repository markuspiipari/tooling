/// Notes:
///
/// * Should you wonder about it in the future: we used to implement the public API here (`AtomicInteger`, `AtomicResource` and
///   `AtomicLock`) by wrapping a `DispatchSemaphore`, which _seemingly_ worked just fine. That approach, however, is not quite
///   the correct use of a signalling API, and also it's effectively equivalent to always locking with a mutex, without the option
///   of allowing multiple concurrent readers on a resource.
///
/// * There are implementations on the interwebs that further wrap this stuff in a property wrapper. As of this writing (for
///   https://gitlab.com/sashimiapp/sashimi/-/issues/344) I am however of the mind that this would make the locking too implicit,
///   and make one not give each case the proper thought they deserve. The need for this type of locking should be the exception,
///   when the default approach of performing standalone background tasks on an operation/dispatch queue isn't enough.
